A good bar needs a good soundtrack. BarBot songs should be robot/booze/bar:

* Starwars Cantina music
* The Bonnie Sots: The Old Dun Cow 
* Flogging Molly: Fuck you I'm Drunk
* Punch Brothers: Rye Whiskey
* The Humans Are Dead
* Jonathon Coulton: Drinking with You
* Tom Waits: Nighthawks at the Diner [album]
* The Pogues: Streams of Whiskey
* Whiskey in the Jar
